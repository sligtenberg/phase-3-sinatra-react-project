# Stevo's Todo List Intro

Stevo's Todo List is a light todo list manager, intended to be used as a personal organization tool.

# Implementation

This application consists of a backend and a frontend repository. First, clone the backend (this repo) to your local environment. Once in the directory, run "bundle install" to install the necessary dependencies. The run "bunde exec rake server" to start the server. Next, from another terminal window, clone the frontend repo - https://github.com/sligtenberg/phase-3-sinatra-react-project-frontend - to your local environment. From that directory, run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies, then run "npm start" to launch the application on a browser tab.

# Using Stevo's Todo List

Start by creating a category by clicking the "New Category" button on the right. This brings up a form where you can choose a name and a color for the category. Next, add tasks to the category by clicking the "New Task" button on the right. Enter a name, and decide whether to flag the task as high priority, then click submit task. Many tasks may be added to a category, and many categories may be created. Existing tasks may be edited by clicking the task name. Tasks may be deleted by clicking the "X" on the right. Tasks may be sorted using the filter bar at the top. You can choose to only see a specific category, and you may also select which priority levels to view.
